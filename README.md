# Relative-Motion-Analysis
This repository holds relevant code I have written for my Senior Design project. This repository holds relevant code I have written for my Senior Design project. I 
performed an analysis of methods to calculate relative motion between a target and a chaser spacecraft using Inertial Equations of Motion and the Clohessy-Wiltshire 
equations. I further scripted an animated 3D plot that shows the propagated trajectories of the target and chaser spacecraft, which I'm really proud of.
