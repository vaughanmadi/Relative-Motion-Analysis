# Relative-Motion-Analysis
This repository holds relevant code I have written for capstone project. I performed an analysis of methods to calculate relative motion between a target and a chaser spacecraft using Inertial Equations of Motion and the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations. I further scripted an animated 3D plot that shows the propagated trajectories of the target and chaser spacecraft. I used this target-chaser model to mimic the functions of the satellite which my team is designing. Its goal is to track and rendezvous with individual pieces of orbital debris, so an understanding of relative motion and trajectories was necessary.
